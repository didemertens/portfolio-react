            <p>A problem-solver at heart, I initially developed a passion for programming during my time as a Dutch translator.
            Because I love to solve problems, I was immediately hooked and taught myself the fundamentals of web development
            through every online resource I could find. I used my newly acquired knowledge to improve the communication about
            upcoming and new translation projects between the localisation and development team, but soon realised I wanted to
            be on the other side of that conversation. I decided it was the right time to switch careers and enrolled in
            General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive. I recently completed this course where in
            addition to finetuning my JavaScript and Python skills, I learned how to build applications using React, Node.js and Django.
            I am currently looking for a position as a web developer in a passionate and supportive team.</p>

                <p>Did you know that trees form a complex community of parents and children?
                  And that the parents actually care for their children by giving them nutrients and looking out for diseases?
                  I didn't either, untill I read Peter Wohlleben's "The Hidden Life of Trees". In this book he shares all of this insights, making you fall in love with trees.
