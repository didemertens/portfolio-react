              <p>A problem-solver at heart, I initially developed a passion for programming during my time as a Dutch translator.
              Because I love to solve problems, I was immediately hooked and taught myself the fundamentals of web development
              through every online resource I could find. I used my newly acquired knowledge to improve the communication about
              upcoming and new translation projects between the localisation and development team, but soon realised I wanted to
              be on the other side of that conversation. I decided it was the right time to switch careers and enrolled in
              General Assemblyâ€™s Software Engineering Immersive. I recently completed this course where in
              addition to finetuning my JavaScript and Python skills, I learned how to build applications using React, Node.js and Django.
            I am currently looking for a position as a web developer in a passionate and supportive team.</p>

                  <h3>Most eye-opening read</h3>
                  <p>Did you know that trees form a complex community of parents and children?
                    And that the parents actually care for their children by giving them nutrients?
                    I didn't either, untill I read Peter Wohlleben's "The Hidden Life of Trees". In this book he shares all of
                    this insights, making you fall in love with trees.

                    <h3>Most beautiful painting</h3>
                    <p>I love Tamara de Lempicka's work. I even copied a couple of her paintings! She was a Polish artist who lived
                      for most of her life in France and the US. She mainly created paintings of women in the Art Deco style.
                      It's a hard choice, but if I have to pick then my favourite work would be "The Sleeper" because of the
                    bold lines and calm colours.</p>

                    <h3>Most inspiring website</h3>
                    <p>My favourite website is <a href="https://canals-amsterdam.nl/">Canals Amsterdam</a>. Not because
                    it's about the Netherlands (although I'm bound to be a bit baised), but because they show the history of
                    the canals in a very unique way. You can take a "scroll" from the 16th century to today, seeing through
                  paintings and pictures how the canals were used during this time.</p>
